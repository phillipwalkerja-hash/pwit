This educational technology course has played a significant role in shaping my understanding of how technology can be meaningfully integrated into teaching and learning. Throughout the course, I was exposed to a wide range of digital tools and instructional strategies that demonstrated how technology can enhance student engagement, creativity, and understanding. I learned that effective use of educational technology is not about using tools for their own sake, but about aligning them with clear learning objectives and using them to support active, student-centered learning. The course also emphasized the importance of planning and intentional design when incorporating technology into lessons.<br>

A major takeaway from this course was the relevance and application of thebISTE Standards in guiding effective technology use in education. The standards reinforced the idea that students should be empowered as digital citizens, knowledge constructors, and creative communicators, while teachers take on the roles of learners, facilitators, and designers of meaningful learning experiences. Through course activities and assignments, I gained a deeper appreciation for ethical technology use, online safety, and responsible digital behavior. The ISTE Standards provided a clear framework for ensuring that technology integration supports both academic growth and the development of essential 21st-century skills.<br>

Overall, this course has increased my confidence in using technology as an instructional tool and has influenced how I envision my future classroom. I now see technology as a means to personalize learning, support collaboration, and provide timely feedback through digital assessments. The reflective nature of the course encouraged me to evaluate my own practices and remain open to continuous learning as technology evolves. As a result, I feel better prepared to create inclusive, engaging, and future-ready learning environments that align with the ISTE Standards and meet the needs of diverse learners.
